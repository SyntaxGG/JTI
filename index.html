        <h2  style="padding-left: 12px; font-size: large;">The day Indians realized that the foreigners that came to the motherland in the name of trade did not settle in and make a company named East India Company just for the trade and had goals of colonizing the land it was too late. The foreigners had already captured a pretty good amount of territories. But since the day of realization various movements and struggles have been started in the motive of bringing what was known as freedom back to the natives.
          “Numerous movements, numerous struggles, numerous martyrs all for what we are at this moment” said Jawaharlal Nehru during the swearing-in ceremony.

      <h2>
      <p>The revolt of 1857 also known as the Indian rebellion of 1857 was a major uprising in India. The rebellion began on 10th may 1857 due to a mutiny of sepoys in the garrison town of Meerut.
      The reason for such an outraged behavior from the sepoys was because of the incident of the greased cartridges of the new enfield rifles. A rumor spread among them that the cartridges of the rifles were greased with fats of cows and pigs. Before loading the sepoys had to bite off the paper on the cartridges. Due to religious beliefs both hindu and muslim sepoys refused to use the rifles. 
      <p>
      <p>On 29 March 1857 at Barrackpore, Sepoy Mangal Pandey of the 34th Bengal Native Infantry attacked his officers. When his comrades were ordered to restrain him they refused, but they stopped short of joining him in open revolt.</p><br><p> As a result of Mangal Pandey’s doings he was executed on 8th April, 1857.
      Although only a handful of sepoys had been involved, the entire regiment was disbanded in disgrace. Sepoys elsewhere thought this too harsh a punishment.</p>
      The Mutiny proper began at Meerut on 10 May 1857. Eighty-five members of the 3rd Bengal Light Cavalry, who had been jailed for refusing to use cartridges they believed to be at odds with their religion, were broken out of prison by their comrades. They ransacked the nearby military station and killed any Europeans they could find.</p>
      </p><br>
      </ol>	
      <ol><h2><li>Branches of the revolt:</li><br>
      Following the outbreak of the Indian Mutiny at Meerut in May 1857, uprisings occurred across northern and central India. The main centres of revolt were Delhi, Cawnpore, Lucknow, Jhansi and Gwalior	
      
      Delhi:
      Delhi was the centre of the uprising. It was ruled by, the old and powerless Mughal Emperor. The mutineers asked him for help and he had agreed. Delhi was a very important territory to recapture for the British because it had a very strategic position between Calicut and a few newly captured territories of Punjab.
      The chain of events slowly unfolded in the following timeline 
      <br><br>
      <p>11 May, 1857<br><br>
      Aided by a mob from the bazaar, the rebels killed Europeans and Indian Christians</li>
      </p>
      7 June, 1857
      A hastily raised force of 4000 men succeded in occupying a ridge overlooking Delhi, but was too weak to overtake the whole city.
      <br><br>
      July - August, 1857<br>
      Faced by over 30000 mutineers  the British came under increasing pressure. The army began to suffer losses through cholera. In searching heat, the British held off repeated efforts to take the ridge back in control.
      
      <br><br>
      
      
      14 August, 1857<br>
      Reinforcements arrived from the Punjab, including a siege train of 32 guns and 2,000 men under Brigadier-General John Nicholson had executed without trial hundreds of mutineers and innocent civillians.
      <br><br>
      14 September 1857<br>
      By September the British had 9,000 men  before Delhi. A third were British, the rest Sikhs, Punjabi Muslims and Gurkhas. The assault began when artillery breached the walls and blew in the Kashmir Gate.
      <br><br>
       14-21 September 1857<br>
      It took a week of vicious street fighting before Delhi was taken. It was then ransacked in an orgy  of looting and killing. But Delhi’s recapture proved the decisive factor in the suppression of the revolt.
      
      <br><br>
      
      Cawnpore :<br><br>
       
      Cawnpore (known as Kanpur at present) was a major crossing point on the River Ganges, and an important junction, where the Grand Trunk Road and the road from Jhansi to Lucknow crossed. In June 1857 the sepoys there rebelled and laid siege to Major-General Sir Hugh Wheeler’s garrison.
      Wheeler had retreated to an entrenchment outside the city. Nana Sahib, a local ruler who had suffered from the British seizure of his estate, led the rebels. For nearly three weeks, under constant fire and a burning sun, 1,000 Britons awaited rescue.<br><br>
      
      The chain of events in Cawnpore unfolded as follows<br>
      25 June 1857<br>
      Nana Sahib learnt that a British relief force was approaching and offered the garrison safe passage downstream to Allahabad. The British boarded waiting boats and were then fired upon. Any men who survived the ambush were immediately killed.
      <div class="images">

      </div> 
      15 June 1857<br>
      The surviving 120 women and children were imprisoned. They were murdered and their bodies thrown down a well when it was heard the British were near.
      <br><br>
      16 July 1857<br>
      Major-General Sir Henry Havelock's relief force reached Cawnpore a day later. After carrying out indiscriminate reprisals against both the guilty and innocent, Havelock marched northwards towards  Lucknow, but was forced to turn back.
      <br><br>
      November 1857<br>
      Cawnpore was then held from July until November, when Lieutenant-General Sir Colin Campbell marched most of its garrison to Lucknow. He left behind a small detachment under Brigadier Charles Windham.
      <br><br>
      26 November 1857<br>
      Nana Sahib’s general, Tantya Tope, had gathered an army to recapture the city. On 26th November, Windham drove off Tantya’s advanced guard,  but was forced back to Wheeler’s old lines. Campbell then returned from Lucknow and found Windham surrounded and Cawnpore in rebel hands.
      <br><br>
       6 December 1857<br>
      Windham’s opening bombardment deceived the rebels that Campbell was about to attack their left. His real attach was made on the right. Campbell’s heavy naval guns were on the decisive factor. As Tantya’s troops broke and fled, Nana Sahib’s men were defeated north of the city.
      <br><br>
       The Devil’s Wind<br>
      The Cawnpore massacre inflamed British feelings. They left the site untouched as a reminder to newly arrived troops. News of the atrocity, and others like it elsewhere, installed a desire for revenge. In the early months of the British recovery few mutineers were captured alive. Thousands were indiscriminately hanged and many innocent civilians killed.
      When trials were held, those convicted of mutiny were blown from cannon. It was a cruel punishment with a religious dimension. By blowing the body to pieces the victim lost hope of entering paradise. The people of northern India called the long period of reprisals ‘the Devil’s Wind’.

      Lucknow :<br>
      <br>
      30 June 1857<br>
      Lawrence’s initial expedition against the rebels at Chinhut was defeated and his men retreated in disorder. The Rebels now besieged the Residency. 
      Lawrence had about 1600 troops, half of them loyal sepoys, to defend the compound, and a similar number of civilians to protect.
      <br><br>
      4 July 1857<br>
      Lawrence was killed when a shell exploded in his room. Command passed to Colonel John Inglis of the 32nd Regiment.
      <br><br>
      26 September 1857<br>
      A relief force of 2500 soldiers and a Major-General Sir Henry Havelock left Cawnpore and fought its way into Lucknow, but after sustaining heavy casualties it was to weak to evacuate the defenders.
      <br><br>
      
      16 November 1857<br> 
      Sir Collin Campbell’s relief force of 4,500 men arrived. They stormed the Secundra Bagh, a walled enclosure that barred the way to the Residency. The British Artillery opened a breach and the infantry stormed inside. In fierce fighting, the killed around 2,500 rebels. 
      <br><br>
      
      22 November 1857<br>
      Campbell was finally able to evacuate the Residency. He left behind a small garrison under Sir James Outram at the Alumbagh, a large enclosure outside the city, to stop the rebels undertaking offensive operations.
      <br><br>
      1 March 1858<br>
      Campbell returned to Lucknow and his reinforced army joined Outram’s 4000 men. 
      <br><br>
      5 March 1858<br>
      Campbell attacked Lucknow in set-piece fashion, moving forward from position to position, after his engineers had constructed bridges across the River Gumti. Over the following days, his gunners blasted their way through the city’s buildings while the infantry engaged in bitter hand-to-hand fighting.
      <br><br>
      14 March 1858<br>
      The Nawab of Oudh's palace was captured and looted, but many of its defenders escaped into the countryside to fight on. Two days later the Residency was secured and Campbell beat off counter-attacks on the Alumbagh and his positions north of the Gumti.
      <br><br>
      Central India:<br> 
      <br><br>
      Opposition to British control of central India centered on Jhansi, where Rani Lakshmi Bai opposed the annexation of her state. In June 1857 the Bengal Army regiments stationed in central India mutinied. The Gwalior Contingent, a force in the service of the pro-British Maharajah Sindia, joined them.

           Birth of INC:
         One of the oldest parties in india, The Indian National Congress was founded on was founded on December 28, 1885. 72 social reformers, journalists and lawyers congregated for the first session of Indian National Congress at Gokuldas Tejpal Sanskrit College, Bombay. The first session of Congress was organized by Allan Octavian Hume along with Dadabhai Naoroji and Dinshaw Wacha. 
         <br><br>For many decades there was a widespread belief that A.O Hume and other liberal-minded British officials thought that the creation of a political outfit would channelize much of the discontent among Indians over various aspects of the British rule into something more benign. However, the so-called ‘safety valve’ theory has been questioned by historians in the post-Independence era who say that many social, cultural, political and economic forces operating in the aftermath of the 1857 revolt were, in fact, responsible for the eventual birth of the party.
         <br><br>In the first two decades after its formation, the Congress was dominated by a group of leaders  <div class="images">

        </div> who came to be known as the ‘Moderates’. They favoured orderly progress and constitutional agitation. But by 1907, a rival group, the ‘Extremists’, who adopted a more aggressive approach towards British rule, also came into prominence. Bal Gangadhar Tilak, the most famous of the ‘Extremists’, in his address to the Indian National Congress in 1907, calling for a boycott of British goods and resistance to British rule, said: “Two new words have recently come into existence with regard to our politics, and they are Moderates and Extremists. These words have a specific relation to time, and they, therefore, will change with time. The Extremists of today will be Moderates tomorrow, just as the Moderates of today were Extremists yesterday. When the National Congress was first started and Mr. Dadabhai’s views, which now go for Moderates, were given to the public, he was styled an Extremist, so that you will see that the term Extremist is an expression of progress.”
       <br><br>The congress truly became a mass party with the arrival of Mahatma Gandhi, who returned from South Africa in 1915. Gandhi introduced methods like satyagraha and civil disobedience to the independence struggle. Gandhi remained a spiritual leader for the party and his presence drew a lot of support from both the elite and the masses. More young leaders like Jawaharlal Nehru, Vallabhbhai Patel, Dr. Rajendra Prasad, C Rajagopalachari, Subhash Chandra Bose, etc. made their presence felt. Congress was now a party that had huge mass support and was the chief political party in the Indian freedom struggle. After the Government of India Act 1935 was passed, provincial elections were held in 1936-37 and out of the 11 provinces, the Congress formed the government in 8 of them except Sindh, Punjab and Bengal. 
         <br><br>After independence, the first Prime Minister of the country, Jawaharlal Nehru was from the party. In the first general elections in 1952, the Congress had a thumping victory and Nehru became the first directly elected PM of India. He presented the first five-year plan on July 9 1951. The total planned budget of Rs. 2069 crore was allocated to seven broad areas, irrigation and energy, agriculture and community development and transport and communications got the highest allocation He was in power till his death in 1964.

    1917: Champaran Satyagraha<br>
    Champaran Satyagraha of 1917 was the first civil disobedience movement organized by Gandhiji. Rajkumar Shukla asked Gandhi to look into the problems of the Indigo planters. The European planters had been forcing passengers to grow Indigo on a 3/20 of the total land called the tinkatiya system. Gandhi organized passive resistance or civil disobedience against the tinkatiya system. Finally, the authorities relented and permitted Gandhi to make inquiries among the peasants. The government appointed a committee to look into the matter and nominated Gandhi as a member.<br><br>
    1918: Kheda satyagraha<br>
    The Kheda Satyagraha was the first noncooperation movement organized by Gandhi because of the drought in 1918 crops failed in the Kheda district of Gujarat. According to the revenue code if the yield was less than one-fourth of the normal produced the farmers for entitled to remission. Gujarat sabha sent a petition requesting revenue assessment for the year 1919 but the authorities refused to grant permission. Gandhi supported the peasants’ cause and asked them to withhold revenue. During the Satyagraha, many young nationalists such as Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel. The government finally agreed to form an agreement with the farmers and hence the taxes were suspended for the years 1919 and 1920 and all confiscated properties were returned.

    This was Gandhi’s first hunger strike. He intervened in a dispute between Mill owners of Ahmedabad and the workers over the issue of discontinuation of the plague bonus.

      <h1>Lucknow Pact</h1>
      <h3></h3>
    </section>
    <ol>
      <h2>
        The Congress-Muslim League Lucknow Pact of 1916 can easily be considered an important landmark during the nationalist movement in India. The Congress leaders agreed to the pact in the expectation that the executive-legislature relationship in the package of constitutional reforms would essentially be a continuation of the Morley-Minto reforms. But the Montagu-Chelmsford reforms, when announced, revealed that the nature of this relationship would be significantly different, leading the Congress leaders to oppose the pact and to the acceptance of communal electorates for the Muslims that it entailed, before the Southborough Committee. The pact also contained significant omissions and ambiguities which led to divergent interpretations on crucial provisions.
    
        <br><br>The Indian National Congress-All India Muslim League (INC – AIML) agreement, popularly known as the Lucknow Pact of 1916, can easily be considered one of the most important events in the trajectory of the nationalist movement in India. In the midst of the ﬁrst world war, in 1916, both organisations presented a joint scheme of constitutional reforms to the colonial rulers with the expectation that this scheme would be implemented once the war ended. This marked the coming together of two major political organisations in the country, which had displayed a marked hostility to each other.
    
        <br><br>The signiﬁcance of the Lucknow Pact lies in the fact that it was the ﬁrst time that the Congress reached an agreement with an organisation which was explicitly a “communal” one while the League, founded to counter the Congress’ claims to represent the whole of India, reached an agreement with same organisation. The main feature of the pact was the demand for an expansion of the representative assemblies, both at the all-India and provincial levels, and appointment of Indians to the executive councils of the viceroy and the provincial governors. But more importantly, the Congress for the ﬁrst time openly and explicitly conceded the principle of communal representation by accepting separate electorates for Muslims, something that it had grudgingly accepted as part of the Morley-Minto package of constitutional reforms. Moreover, Muslims were granted a ﬁxed proportion of seats both in the all-India and the provincial legislatures. Since the pact was announced and approved at the annual sessions of the two political organisations held at Lucknow in 1916, it is referred to, in the city’s name.
    
        <br><br>Most of the same Congress leaders <div class="images">

        </div> who supported the pact and the principles embodied in it went back on their support and signalled their opposition soon afterwards in the submissions to the Indian Franchise Committee (known as the Southborough Committee after its chairman, Southborough). This committee, along with the Committee on the Division of Functions, was appointed to work out the details of the post-war package of constitutional reforms, known as the Montagu-Chelmsford reforms after its principal architects – the then secretary of state for India, Edwin Montagu and the viceroy, Chelmsford. This crucial piece of evidence – the proceedings of the Southborough Committee – has been completely overlooked in the major literature on the Lucknow Pact and its signiﬁcance.
    
        <br><br>The discussion of the pact has overlooked these aspects of the politics surrounding it. In the colonial period, it was seen as an important landmark in the development of Indian nationalism and an instance of political cooperation between the two important religious communities (Coupland 1944: 47; Report on Indian Constitutional Reforms 1918: 16; Sitaramayya 1935: 44 and 215). In the post-independence period, this view was accepted, both ofﬁcially (Chand 2005: 347) and in scholarly writings (Hasan 1979: 77). A second more qualiﬁed view accepts the above position but also points that with the pact the Congress “compromised its position as the representative organisation of all Indians” by accepting the representative character of the League (Prasad 2009: 151). B R Ambedkar had earlier opined that despite the concessions on the part of the Hindus, the pact did not produce any rapprochement between the two communities (Ambedkar 1946: 299).
    
        <br><br>A third approach takes a completely negative view of the pact, which is characterised as “a surrender to Muslim communalism and separatism” (Mehrotra 1979: 227). Furthermore, it has also been argued out that since those Muslim League leaders were not representative of the Indian Muslim community, it was merely a “deal” between the Congress and “the ‘UP’ Young Party leaders of the Muslim League” (Robinson 2008: 256). The Lucknow Pact has also been cited to argue that colonial India, at least from 1919 onwards, was a “consociational state” (Wilkinson 2000).<br>
    The ultimate acceptance of the Lucknow Pact was preceded by long-drawn out negotiations which began in 1915. Till December 1916, the leaders of both the Congress and the Muslim League were engaged in thrashing out the details of the pact and at the same time whittling down opposition from within their respective organisations. All the details of the pact were not settled by the time both the parties met in Lucknow in December 1916 (Owen 1972; Robinson 2008).

    <ol>
      <h2>
        Introduction: 
        <br><br>On 8th of August, 1942 Gandhiji called to end British rule and launched the Quit India Movement  at the Maharashtra meeting of All India Congress Committee (AICC). The Bharat Chhodo Andolan, as it was often known, was a countrywide act of civil disobedience in India. This was the last mass movement launched by Mahatma Gandhi. During this situation, Mahatma Gandhi delivered a powerful address at the start of the campaign and used the slogan “Do or Die” in his speech delivered at the Gowalia Tank Maidan, now popularly known as August Kranti Maidan. The British government responded to the passing of Quit India resolution by arresting the major leaders of the Congress Working Committee. It was left to a young Aruna Asaf Ali to lead the movement. She was an Indian freedom fighter who is best known for hoisting Indian National Congress flag at the Gowalia Tank maidan in Bombay during the Quit India Movement. She earned the title “Heroine of the 1942 movement”. She represented the linkage of the women’s rights movement with the freedom struggle. He urged the British to leave India promptly or face serious consequences. As part of this effort, a call for mass agitation was issued, which triggered violent clashes and the arrest of Indian National Congress leaders. “Quit India” was coined by Yusuf Maharelly, the then mayor of Mumbai. He also coined the slogan “Simon Go Back.” 
        
        <br><br>Major Causes of the movement: 
        <br>Failure of the Cripps Mission, refusal of unconditional support by the Indian National Congress and nationwide enthusiasm for complete freedom were some factors that triggered this movement. Sir Stafford Cripps, who was a member of World War II, War Cabinet, tried to gather the contribution of Indian soldiers for the United Kingdom’s cause. Cripps came to India to get the approval of Indian leaders and to explain the reasoning for India’s joining the British in World War II. Cripps’s agenda was to meet with Indian leaders and gather support for the British government’s Draft Declaration. After the war, the declaration also conferred India Dominion Status. Congress refused to discuss any agreements unless complete freedom was on the table. From this point on, the demand for complete freedom gained popularity among the revolutionaries and the public.

        <br><br>First Phase: 
        <br>Strikes and rallies were held around the country, and workers showed their solidarity by refusing to work in the factories.

        <br> The third phase of the movement was marked by the formation of local government at different levels, depicting the people’s acceptance of authority figures.

The Hindu Mahasabha openly opposed the call for the Quit India Movement and boycotted it officially under the apprehension that the movement would create internal disorder and would endanger internal security during the war.

          Introduction: 
          <br><br>On 8th of August, 1942 Gandhiji called to end British rule and launched the Quit India Movement  at the Maharashtra meeting of All India Congress Committee (AICC). The Bharat Chhodo Andolan, as it was often known, was a countrywide act of civil disobedience in India. This was the last mass movement launched by Mahatma Gandhi. During this situation, Mahatma Gandhi delivered a powerful address at the start of the campaign and used the slogan “Do or Die” in his speech delivered at the Gowalia Tank Maidan, now popularly known as August Kranti Maidan. The British government responded to the passing of Quit India resolution by arresting the major leaders of the Congress Working Committee. It was left to a young Aruna Asaf Ali to lead the movement. She was an Indian freedom fighter who is best known for hoisting Indian National Congress flag at the Gowalia Tank maidan in Bombay during the Quit India Movement. She earned the title “Heroine of the 1942 movement”. She represented the linkage of the women’s rights movement with the freedom struggle. He urged the British to leave India promptly or face serious consequences. As part of this effort, a call for mass agitation was issued, which triggered violent clashes and the arrest of Indian National Congress leaders. “Quit India” was coined by Yusuf Maharelly, the then mayor of Mumbai. He also coined the slogan “Simon Go Back.” 
          
          <br><br>Major Causes of the movement: 
          <br>Failure of the Cripps Mission, refusal of unconditional support by the Indian National Congress and nationwide enthusiasm for complete freedom were some factors that triggered this movement. Sir Stafford Cripps, who was a member of World War II, War Cabinet, tried to gather the contribution of Indian soldiers for the United Kingdom’s cause. Cripps came to India to get the approval of Indian leaders and to explain the reasoning for India’s joining the British in World War II. Cripps’s agenda was to meet with Indian leaders and gather support for the British government’s Draft Declaration. After the war, the declaration also conferred India Dominion Status. Congress refused to discuss any agreements unless complete freedom was on the table. From this point on, the demand for complete freedom gained popularity among the revolutionaries and the public. World War II, the spark of complete freedom and the struggling Indian economy culminated in the Quit India Movement.
